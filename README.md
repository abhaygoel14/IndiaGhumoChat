BOT :
Hustling here and there for hotels, transport, and food makes it very complicated. It makes everyone anxious about wasting money on such businesses again. To make this experience more fruitful, we also created a discord bot, where our members can ask for their queries. By doing so, it nullifies the stress and the doubts that make people have second thoughts.

Reflection

This was a week long project built during our Matchr internship. Project goals included using technologies we have learned up until this point and familiarizing ourself with new technologies.
The primary purpose of our project to create a community where all the travel buffs can come together. Members include real travelers who regularly post journal entries, articles, and photographs, sharing their personal traveling experiences.
